        <h2 class="experience">My experience</h2>
          <p>I have worked in multiple jobs over the years that shaped my current skillsets.</p>
          <p>Mostly i have worked in manufactoring companies that make automobile and motorcycle parts but my curiosity got the better of me, so i even tried applying my people skils in personal security services, customer support through phone, sales and so on.
             I have even worked with archeologists as a student helper, but none were so interesting as web development where you can be very creative, which i love.</p>

              <li>Reading books</li>

              <li>Playing guitar</li>

            </ul>
          <p>These are just some of my hobbies that i have. I am interested in a vast variety of things, and always love to learn new things and develop my skillsets
          so i try to read as much as i can and learn as much as i can. For as the character from Game of Thrones says:<p>
