        <p>Im a personal trainer that took interest in web development. Since i first heard about web development i wanted to learn it. Ever since i was a little boy i loved computers and everything that has to do with the internet, i also sometimes play online games, and i am looking to provide my personal training services through the web.</p>
        <p>I have worked in multiple jobs over the years that shaped my current skillsets. I have worked in personal security, manufactoring of automobile and motorcycle parts i even worked with archeologists as a student helper, but none were so interesting as web development.</p>
